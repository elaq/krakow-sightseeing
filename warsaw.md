# [Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw) sightseeing

## Info

* [BBC forecast](http://www.bbc.com/weather/756135)

* transport: [public](http://warszawa.jakdojade.pl/) and Uber or taxi (I'd recommend [Ele Taxi](http://en.eletaxi.pl)). Avoid taking random taxis from the street - some companies are not playing fair and charge twice as much or even more.

* [Polish language](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/polish/soap/facts.shtml)

* Polish [dishes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/proof-polish-food-isnt-all-disgusting) and [ingredients](http://www.tastingpoland.com/food/polish_food_ingredients.html)

* [train tickets](https://www.intercity.pl/en/site/for-passengers/information/journey-planner.html) - the main railway station is called Warszawa Centralna. Polish railways are called PKP Intercity. You can buy tickets online, if you encounter any problems with that let me know, I can buy one for you

* [public transport](http://www.ztm.waw.pl/index.php?c=110&l=2) in Warsaw is called ZTM - we have a card similar to Oyster, but it's available only for people living in Warsaw, you'll be good with paper tickets. There are ticket machines in some buses/trains but it's safer to buy the tickets earlier in any newsagent's e.g. you can find some in the main hall at the main railway station. Rememeber to validate the paper ticket once you get on a bus/tram! If you buy a daily ticket, then you need to validate it only once on your first journey. You can buy the tickets with a mobile app too, I use the one called SkyCash ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skycash.beta) and [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/skycash/id320226186) - I'm not sure if it's transalted into English though...

* Don't be surprised to meet people not speaking English at all or sepaking very poorly. Most of people above 40 years old may not speak English well as they learned Russian at school. Most of young people do speak English on a decent level.

#### Trips

* [Kraków](https://github.com/elaq/sightseeing/blob/master/krakow.md) - unfortunately there must be some railway works on the way to Krakow, because it takes around 1 hour longer to get to Krakow than usual... It's around 3 hours 25 minutes to get there (one-way), which makes it probably too far for a one-day trip (?). On the other hand, the train is comfortable and the restaurant coach is a part of it, so you can have a decent breakfast/dinner without losing time. 4 hours in Krakow should be enough to see most famous places (they are all within 30 minutes on foot from the railway station). If you are not planning to come to Poland again soon then you may want to give it a try as many people claim Krakow is the most beautiful Polish city. If you would like to spend the whole weekend in Krakow, I can recommend you quite new Ibis hotels very close to the railway station (there is a cheap but not bad Ibis Budget and a regular Ibis hotel at Pawia Street).

* [Gdańsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricity,_Poland) - also a very nice and big city at the seaside, there are 2 other cities nearby called Gdynia (with a harbour) and Sopot (with nice, sandy beaches). I can recommend you to get off the train either in Gdansk (for sightseeing) or in Sopot (if the weather is hot and sunny you can enjoy it at the beach :-)). It takes around 2 hours 45 minutes to get to Gdansk and 3 hours 5 minutes to get to Sopot. The train is very similar to the one that goes to Krakow, very comfortable, with restaurant coach and air-conditioning.
