# [Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw) sightseeing

## Info

* [BBC weather forecast](http://www.bbc.com/weather/756135)

* Uber or taxis (I'd recommend [Ele Taxi](http://en.eletaxi.pl)). Avoid taking taxis with random logos from the street - some companies are not playing fair and charge twice as much or even more (as far as I know it's not as bad in Warsaw as in Krakow, but be careful). You probably should be able to find Ele Taxi at the airport. There is also a train and a bus 175 going from the airport to the main railway station .

* public transport (called ZTM): [tickets](http://www.ztm.waw.pl/index.php?c=110&l=2) and [here you can find the route](http://warszawa.jakdojade.pl/). You will need paper tickets for zone 1. There are ticket machines in some buses/trains, but it's probably safer to buy the tickets earlier in any newsagent's e.g. you can find some in the main hall at the main railway station. Rememeber to validate the paper ticket once you get on a bus/tram and before entering the underground. If you buy a daily ticket, then you need to validate it only once on your first journey. You can buy the tickets with a mobile app too. I use the one called SkyCash ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skycash.beta) and [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/skycash/id320226186) - I'm not sure if it's transalted into English though... There are only 2 tube lines in Warsaw, but trams and buses are really good (buses are much faster than in London, especially the ones with numbers starting with "5").

* [train tickets](https://www.intercity.pl/en/site/for-passengers/information/journey-planner.html) - the main railway station is called Warszawa Centralna. Polish railways are called PKP Intercity. You can buy tickets both online and at the railway station - it's better to buy them in advance (because they are cheaper and some trains are full). Make sure you book trains with EIP in their names (avoid TLK, EIC and IC - some of them don't have air conditioning or restaurant coach and they are not as comfortable as EIP).

* [Polish language](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/polish/soap/facts.shtml)

* Polish [dishes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/proof-polish-food-isnt-all-disgusting) and [ingredients](http://www.tastingpoland.com/food/polish_food_ingredients.html)

* Don't be surprised to meet people not speaking English at all or sepaking very poorly. Most of people above 40 years old may not speak English well as they learned Russian at school. Most of young people do speak English on a decent level.

## History

* interesting reading on history of Warsaw: [1](http://www.localhistories.org/warsaw.html), [2](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/25/meet-poles-who-went-home-warsaw-london-poland-return)

* Saski palace [before WW2](http://fotopolska.eu/foto/173/173259.jpg), [after war](https://www.warszawa.ap.gov.pl/saska/img/08-07.jpg) and [now](http://10bkpanc.wp.mil.pl/plik/image/2015_aktualnosci/09_wrzesien/aktualnosci_201506492.jpg)

## [City Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Śródmieście,_Warsaw)

* many people say it's concrete and ugly and probably they are right. I think it has improved recently, with new skyscrapers and old building renovations though.

* [Pałac Kultury i Nauki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Culture_and_Science) - there are few people saying it should be demolished as it is a gift from Joseph Stalin. It became a "symbol" of Warsaw though and most people cannot imagine the city without it.

* [Hotel Mariott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrum_LIM) - the oldest and most famous skyscraper in Warsaw

* [Central Railway Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warszawa_Centralna_railway_station)

* [Złote Tarasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Złote_Tarasy) - shopping mall in the city centre with an interesting look

## Old Warsaw
I'd recommend you to go for a walk starting from the beginning of Nowy Świat Street, through Krakowskie Przedmieście and ending up in the Old Town

#### [Nowy Świat Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowy_Świat_Street) and [Krakowskie Przedmieście Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakowskie_Przedmieście)

* [Holy Cross Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Cross_Church,_Warsaw) - you'll pass a couple of churches, but this one is probably the most famous one in Warsaw. Chopin's heart is buried here in one of the pillars.

* [Presidential Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Palace,_Warsaw)

* [Pilsudski Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piłsudski_Square) with [Tomb of the Unknown Soldier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier_(Warsaw)) and [National Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Theatre,_Warsaw) - they are not directly at Nowy Świat Street, but very close to it

#### [Castle Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Square,_Warsaw)

* [Royal Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Castle,_Warsaw) - it was rebuilt after WW2 in seventies, but looks identical to the previous one :-)

* [Sigismund's Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund%27s_Column)

#### [Old Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Old_Town)

* [St. John's Archcathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_Archcathedral,_Warsaw)

* [Market Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Market_Place,_Warsaw) - with [Mermaid statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_of_Warsaw), which is a symbol of Warsaw

* [Statue of "Little Insurrectionist"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mały_Powstaniec) - a small statue, but with a touching story

* [Barbican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Barbican)

* if you are not exhausted yet :-), you may also want to see [Warsaw Uprising Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising_Monument)

## [Copernicus Science Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Science_Centre)

## [Multimedia Fountain Park](http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/multimedia-fountain-park-multimedialny-park-fontann-161002.html)

* if you fancy a fountains laser show, it's there for you at 9:30 pm on Friday and Saturday :-) the fountain is not huge, but the [show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0AnDdRTXe0) is not bad

## [ZOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Zoo)

* if you feel like going to a ZOO, there is a nice one in Warsaw (and with a very bad [website](http://zoo.waw.pl/en/))

## [Fotoplastikon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Fotoplastikon)

* if you like old-fashioned attractions, that's an interesting thing to see and it's near the central railway station

## Trips outside of Warsaw

* [Kraków](https://github.com/elaq/sightseeing/blob/master/krakow.md) - many people claim Krakow is the most beautiful Polish city. Unfortunately there are some railway works on the way to Krakow, because it takes around 1 hour longer than usual to get to Krakow from Warsaw - around 3 hours 25 minutes (one-way). The train is very comfortable though and have a restaurant coach, so you could have a breakfast/dinner without losing time. If you buy first class ticket you will get a decent meal directly to your seat for free. The 1-class ticket is probably around 30 pounds one-way (the earlier you buy, the cheaper the ticket). 4 hours in Krakow should be enough to see most famous places (they are all within 30 minutes on foot from the railway station). If you would like to spend the whole weekend in Krakow, I can recommend you the Ibis hotel very close to the railway station (at Pawia Street).

* [Gdańsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricity,_Poland) - also a very nice and big city at the seaside, there are 2 other cities nearby called Gdynia (with a harbour) and Sopot (with a nice, sandy beach). I can recommend you to get off the train either in Gdansk (for sightseeing) or in Sopot (for sunbathing :-)). It takes around 2 hours 45 minutes to get to Gdansk and 3 hours 5 minutes to get to Sopot. The train is similar to the one that goes to Krakow.

* [Częstochowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Częstochowa) - my home town, city with an old monastery and nice [surroundings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olsztyn_Castle_(Silesian_Voivodeship)), but this time please better go to Krakow instead! :-)

* unfortunately there are no places worth visiting very close to Warsaw... The one worth a mention is [Żelazowa Wola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Żelazowa_Wola) with a very nice park. This is the place where Frederic Chopin was born, however, getting there from Warsaw with a publich transport would be terrible so I defeinitely don't recommend you to go there.

## Restaurants

* [Czerwony Wieprz](http://www.czerwonywieprz.pl/en) (Red Hog) - I haven't been there for a long time, but it used to be a very good restaurant arranged in a "communist" style and serving traditional Polish food

* [Va Piano](http://pl.vapiano.com/en/welcome/) - Italian food. I tried it in London first, very good for a quick and tasty dinner

* [Spazza Napoli](http://spaccanapoli.pl/en/) - I've heard they have the best pizza in Warsaw

* [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx.pl) - chain restaurants, popular in shopping malls; looks like they don't have English website

* cafes: Blikle at Nowy Świat Street is really good (known for their ["pączek"](http://www.blikle.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paczek2.jpg) with rose filling) and Wedel (you can find them in shopping malls, but the oldest cafe is at Szpitalna Street) - they are known for their hot chocholate

* in terms of pubs - there are a lot of new nice pubs at the Vistula bank. They are very crowded during the weekend, so probably it's better to go there during the week, e.g. ["Cud Nad Wisłą"](http://cudnadwisla.com)

* generally the old town and Krakowskie Przedmieście are full of restaurants and probably most of them are not bad :-) Polish food is really good, give it a try!
