# Krakow sightseeing

## Info

* [bbc forecast](http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/3094802)

* [public transport in Krakow](http://krakow.jakdojade.pl/)

## [Old town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Old_Town)

#### [Main square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Square,_Krak%C3%B3w)

* [Sukiennice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Cloth_Hall)

* [St Mary's Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Basilica,_Krak%C3%B3w) with an impressive [altar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Altar_of_Veit_Stoss,_St._Mary%27s_Church,_Krakow,_Poland.jpg). Church is open till 6pm. There is an ["anthem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Trumpet_Call) being played every hour from the tower of this church.

* [Underground Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rynek_Underground_permanent_exhibition) - popular museum, I don't recommend it though. The only part I found interesting were movies about history of Poland at the end of exhibition.

#### Other (close to the main square)

* [Florian's Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Florian%27s_Gate)

* [Barbican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Barbican)

* [Juliusz Slowacki Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliusz_S%C5%82owacki_Theatre)

* [Jagiellonian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_University) - main campus of the oldest Polish university (I think it's not very impressive though, so it's not a must-see), established in 1364

* [Planty Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planty_Park) - just a dozen of trees close to the old town, but it's very famous :-)

## [Wawel hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel)

#### [Wawel Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel_Castle)

* the interiors will be closed in the evenings, but the courtyards are open till 8pm

* don't miss the [rennaisance courtyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel#/media/File:Wawel_Krakow_June_2006_002.jpg)

* [Lady with an Ermin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine) is on display here - it's probably one of the most famous piece of art in Poland (the opening hours are short I suppose)

* nice view over Krakow and Vistula river from the hill

#### [Wawel Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel_Cathedral)

* worth to visit, many Polish kings are buried here. The cathedral gets closed at 5pm, but the website says there is a mass at 5:30pm, so it's probably possible to enter during the mass

#### [Wawel Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel_Dragon)

* sculpture by Vistula river (below the hill). It's a "symbol of Krakow", the sculpture is not very impressive though, it breathes with fire from time to time :-)

## [Kazimierz (Jewish district)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz)

* inhabited by Jews before II WW. There are plenty of restaurants serving Jewish food e.g. at Szeroka street.

## [Kosciuszko Mound]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Mound)

* good place for a pleasant walk (there are some buses going there too), very nice view over Krakow and nice green surroundings, open till sunset. Best [walk along the river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistulan_Boulevards_in_Krak%C3%B3w) (as long as there is a path), on the same side of the river as Kosciuszko Mound.

# Other

* [Oskar Schindler's Factory](http://www.mhk.pl/branches/oskar-schindlers-factory) -  really good museum about Krakow during II WW. It's probably better to buy tickets in advance. It's open Tue-Sun till 8pm. You can walk from the Museum to Kazimierz through [Kladka Ojca Bernatka](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%82adka_Ojca_Bernatka#/media/File:Bernatek_footbridge_(view_from_W_at_night),_Krakow,_Poland.jpg) (foot bridge)

## Near Krakow

* [Wieliczka salt mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieliczka_Salt_Mine) - open 7:30-19:30, if you have time in the evening, this is one of the top attractions close to Krakow. You should buy a ticket in advance.

* [Tyniec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyniec) - too far and it's not a top attraction, but to make the story complete I put it here :-)

* [Auschwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp) - around 1h by car from Krakow, there are plenty of companies that orgainze trips for toursits

## Restaurants

* [Wierzynek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wierzynek) - the oldest Polish restaurant
